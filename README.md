# RidgeRegression
# Using the day_hour_count dataframe create two dataframes monday and saturday that represent the data for those days. (hint: Monday is day=0)
# 2a. Create 3 models fit to monday.hour_of_day with varying polynomial degrees ( choose from n=1,2,3,5,10,15). (Repeat for saturday below)
Plot all the results for each polynomial.
 
# 2b. Repeat 2a for saturday.hour_of_day
 
# 3. create 3 new models fit to hour_of_day with different Ridge Regression  (alpha) Ridge Coefficient values using the monday and saturday datasets.
